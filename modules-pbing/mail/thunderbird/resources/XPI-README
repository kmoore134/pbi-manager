Installing the Enigmail / Lightning XPI plugins for Thunderbird
---------------------------------------------------------------

This PBI of Thunderbird may also contain plugins from the 
Enigmail / Lightning FreeBSD ports. The default location for 
these XPI plugins is:

Enigmail:
/Programs/Thunderbird/share/enigmail

Lightning
/Programs/Thunderbird/share/lightning

If you wish to use either of these plugins, you will need to install 
them via the Plugin Manager in Thunderbird.

Thunderbird -> Tools -> Add-ons -> Extensions -> Install

Navigate to the desired plugin, select it and thunderbird will begin an
installation of it.
