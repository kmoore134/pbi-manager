Bacula-Bat PBI changelog:

0.1 (04.Mar.2008)
* initial release
* includes script bat.sh that prompts for configurations found from ~/.bacula-bat

0.2 (14.Mar.2008)
* add a Kommander (1.3 from KDE 3.5.9) script bat.kmdr that uses bat.sh for listing configurations and for executing bat
* bat.kmdr is executed via bat-kommander.sh that would fall back to bat.sh if 'kmdr-executor' is not found
* if bat.kmdr finds only one configuration, bat is executed with that configuration
* replace in KMenu: "Bat" -> "Bat - sh"
* add to KMenu: "Bat - kommander"
* add option to launch the program after installing it
* remove previous installations of Bacula Bat PBI before installation (PBI.FirstRun.sh)
* remove KMenu entry ("/usr/local/share/applnk/Bacula Bat/") upon uninstall

0.3 (02.Apr.2008)
* link manual page to /usr/local/man/man1/bat.1.gz
* link bat binary to /usr/local/bin/bat
* PBI.FirstRun.sh doesn't want a confirmation about removing previous versions if none was found
* bat-kommander.sh: bugfix - locate the bat.kmdr better
* bat.kmdr: bugfix - compatibility for Kommander 1.2 - use exec() instead of execBackground()
* QT4 libraries were upgraded: 4.3.1 -> 4.3.4

0.4 (09.Jun.2008)
* bat.kmdr: show a simple status text under buttons: advertise launching Bat and set it back to default after 3 seconds
* bat.kmdr: Bat's configurations' directory can be selected, it's saved for the next time too
* bat.kmdr: bugfix - lay items out in a grid, so that resizing works correctly
* bat.kmdr: bugfix - if bat.sh ain't found from within path, search it from current directory (the search just didn't work)

0.5 (16.Jun.2008)
* Bat: updated 2.2.8 -> 2.4.0
* new icons for bat.sh and bat-kommander.sh - combined from the original Bat icon and Konsole/Kommander icon
* bat.kmdr: use statusbar instead of label to show status
* bat.kmdr: bugfix - don't block the dialog after launching Bat - use timer instead of exec("sleep 3")

0.6 (16.Jun.2008)
* add Update URL
* add header.png

0.7 (25.Jun.2008)
* add header.png and leftside.png by Gonzalo
* mention where the kmdr-executor may be found
* move icons to share/pixmaps
* link icons to /usr/local/share/pixmaps/
* link bat binary to /usr/local/sbin/bat instead of /usr/local/bin/bat
* create KMenu icons under Utilities - putting them under subdir just didn't work
* PBI.RemoveScript.sh: remove the unneeded question about KMenu icons - they were removed anyway
* PBI.FirstRun.sh: also remove /Programs/BaculaBat, if found
* bat.kmdr: add icon to the dialog
* include bat.conf.sample in etc/ and link it to /usr/local/etc/bat.conf.sample

0.8 (13.Oct.2008)
* bat-kommander.sh: try using kommander (KDE4) too
* PBI.SetupScript.sh: as kommander on KDE4 is not stable yet, warn user about it

(07.Jan.2009)
* Kris Moore integrated kmdr-executor in PBI

(10.Mar.2009)
* revert Kris' changes of copy-files - make it optimal again
* update for 7.1
  * manipulate links under /PCBSD/local instead of /usr/local

(18.Mar.2009)
* PBI.SetupScript.sh: Kris made the PBI usable on PC-BSD < 7.1 - use $BASE instead of /PCBSD/local

(23.Mar.2009)
* PBI.FirstRun.sh, PBI.RemoveScript.sh: use $BASE instead of /PCBSD/local in other scripts too

(26.Mar.2009)
* PBI.FirstRun.sh: remove old versions of PBI with PBI.RemoveScript.sh, fall back on rm -rf if the script doesn't exist

(31.Mar.2009)
* PBI.SetupScript.sh: replace ${BASE} with value of ${BASE} in PBI.RemoveScript.sh, because ${BASE} is not set when the script is executed while removing PBI

TODO:
* bat.kmdr: remember/save the size of the dialog on exit (currently not possible in Kommander <= 1.3)
