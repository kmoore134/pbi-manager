QMC2 has been rebuilt from scratch as a Qt 4 project. Parts of the design and code were inspired by its predecessor, but it's not just a remake. We tried to make the new design as flexible as possible to minimize dependencies from front end and CLI related MAME changes, which was a major deficiency of QMamecat. QMC2 now uses a template based emulator configuration scheme, which can easily be enhanced with additional command line options (defined in an XML template file).<br>As a result of this flexible design, QMC2 can be used for multiple emulators.

Tron was an arcade game based on the movie of the same name, release by Disney in 1982. The original game consisted of 4 sub-games, the only one of concern is the 'Light Cycles' one, in which the player uses a left/right joystick to control a 'Light Cycle' which leaves a wall behind it wherever the cycle it goes, turning only at 90 degree angles (well, on most servers anyways). The player must then force his opponents to crash into their wall while avoiding his opponents walls. Those were the humble beginnings of Armagetron Advanced's game play, which has now blossomed into 16 player mayhem, with highly advanced AI, network game play, and of course all in a 3D environment.<br>WWW: http://armagetronad.net/ ::::::::::::::::::::

This would enable backups on cheap single layer DVDRs (double layer burners weren't even available that time).<br>Vamps builds a wrapper around the requantizer to extract the elementary MPEG2 video stream from the DVD's program stream, feed it through the requantizer and finally re-pack it into the program stream again. Besides this, Vamps allows the selection of both audio and subtitle streams that should be copied into the output stream. This gives another small gain of disk space, since unwanted streams may be discarded.<br>Summed up, Vamps is only a very basic, but nevertheless essential tool to transcode DVD videos to a smaller size. Vamps does not need to write temporary data files, which is a major pro. Vamps is very fast. The downside is, that Vamps is not capable of making DVD backups on its own.<br>WWW: http://vamps.sourceforge.net/ ::::::::::::::::::::
